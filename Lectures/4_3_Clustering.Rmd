Clustering

- No research question, no prediction goal. 
  - Just to **learn** about the structure of data. 
- k refers to the number of grops
  1. Choose initial centroids at random
  2. Assign observations to each centroid based on Euclidean distance
  3. Calculate new centroid based on mean of each variable
  4. Repeat until assignments stabilize
  
```{r}
require(tidyverse)
dat <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2023/main/Lectures/8_Clustering_NLP/data/H097_members.csv")

glimpse(dat)

# scatter
dat%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=nominate_dim1, y=nominate_dim2))+
  geom_point()


```
